Genres: Adventure | Western

Cast: Clint Eastwood (Blondie), Eli Wallach (Tuco) and Lee Van Cleef (Angel Eyes)

Director: Sergio Leone

It’s a classic movie which brilliantly shows different colors of life in old times. It has varied emotions of greed, confrontation, tolerance, compassion and vigilance. It’s directed on a vast land, public area, detention center, bridges, church, rehabilitation center all of old times.

The movie revolves around 3 gunmen and their revolvers. One of them, Tuco (the ugly), is a bandit who is wanted in many crimes and has reward on him. But considering himself courageous, he usually gets himself handed over to police in return for a share of the reward. His savior, Blondie (the good), is a sharp shooter and this skill saves Tuco each time. Angel Eyes (the bad) is introduced as a killer who works on tasks assigned in return for some cash. During one such task, he gets to know about gold treasure. He then gets in quest of it and tries to search for Jackson who knows the treasure location. But luckily, Tuco and Blondie get to know of the location first and Jackson dies soon after telling them. Though they had turned into enemies but still they have to keep each other safe as Tuco was told the location of cemetery while Blondie was told the grave name. Now what follows is a struggle to reach the location first.

The movie cleverly shows how they navigate the country amid the war. The characters are nicely portrayed with Blondie being compassionate, sharp shooter, composed, alert and lucky. He has a humane side even though he is initially shown as a friend of a bandit. His actions and reasoning are aligned with his benevolent nature many a times in the movie. Tuco is also sharp shooter and alert but he isn't a tactical person. He doesn't seem to carry the kind nature and is shown to be carried away by greed. Angel Eyes has relatively small role but he still gets to leave his mark on the viewers. He is depicted as a tactical and vigilant man and the name "Angel Eyes" suits the character. 

Overall it’s a good and recommendable movie.
