The Good, the bad and the ugly (1966) 

Genres: Adventure | Western

Cast: Clint Eastwood (Blondie), Eli Wallach (Tuco) and Lee Van Cleef (Angel Eyes)

Director: Sergio Leone

It’s a classic movie which brilliantly shows different colors of life in old times. Emotions of greed, confrontation, tolerance, compassion and vigilance are presented. Based on civil war, landscapes shown are as diverse as barren land, public area, detention center and church.

The movie revolves around 3 gunmen traversing the war ravaged country for easy money. One of them, Tuco (the ugly), is a bandit who is wanted in many crimes and has reward on him. But considering himself courageous, he usually gets himself handed over to police by Blondie (the good). He then escapes with Blondie's help and shares the reward with him. Angel Eyes (the bad) is introduced as a contract killer. During one such contract, he gets to know about a gold treasure. In its quest, he tries to search for Jackson who knows the treasure location. But luckily, Tuco and Blondie are first to know of the location from Jackson just before he dies. Now what follows is a struggle to reach the location first.

The movie cleverly shows how they navigate the country amid the war. The characters are nicely portrayed with Blondie being compassionate and composed besides being a sharp shooter, alert and lucky. He has a humane side even though he is initially shown as a friend of a bandit. His actions and reasoning are aligned with his benevolent nature many a times in the movie. Tuco is also sharp shooter and alert but he isn't a tactical person. He doesn't seem to carry the kind nature and is shown to be carried away by greed. Angel Eyes has relatively small role but he still gets to leave his mark on the viewers. He is depicted as a tactical and vigilant man and the name "Angel Eyes" suits the character. 

Overall it’s a good and recommendable movie.
