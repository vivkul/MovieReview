The Good, the bad and the ugly (1966)                                                           Review by Viveka Kulharia

A colorful yet classic movie 

It’s a classic movie, which brilliantly shows different colors of life in the old times. Emotions of greed, confrontation, tolerance, compassion and vigilance are presented. Based on civil war, landscapes shown are as diverse as barren land, public area, detention center and church. 

The movie revolves around 3 gunmen traversing the war ravaged country for easy money. One of them, Tuco (the ugly), is a bandit who is wanted for many crimes and has reward offered for his head. But considering himself courageous, he usually gets himself handed over to police by Blondie (the good) with the agreement that Blondie later helps him escape the custody and share the reward. Angel Eyes (the bad) is introduced as a contract killer. During one such contract, he gets to know about a treasure. In its quest, he tries to search for a man named Jackson who knows the treasure location. But luckily, Tuco and Blondie are first to know of the location from Jackson just before he dies. Now what follows is a struggle to reach the location first. 

The movie cleverly shows how they navigate the country amid the war. The characters are nicely portrayed with Blondie being compassionate and composed, besides being a sharp shooter, alert and lucky. He has a humane side, even though he is initially shown to be the friend of a bandit. His actions and reasoning align with his benevolent nature many times in the movie. Tuco is also sharp shooter and alert, but he isn't a tactical person. He doesn't carry similar compassionate nature and is shown to be carried away by greed. Angel Eyes has a relatively small role but he still leaves his mark on the viewers. He is depicted as a tactical and vigilant man and the name "Angel Eyes" suits the character. 

Overall it’s a good and recommendable movie.
